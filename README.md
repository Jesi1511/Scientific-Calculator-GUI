### Basics

- **Python:** Dynamically Typed, Object-Oriented Programming Language
- **Tkinter:** Inbuilt Python module for creating simple GUI apps, serving as the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.
- **Tk:** The toolkit itself
- **mainloop():** The most important function when working with Tkinter, called only once. It initiates an infinite loop to handle GUI events.

### Basic Code for Tkinter

```python
from tkinter import *

root = Tk()  # 'root' is an object of the 'Tk' class 
             # creates a basic GUI 
             # basic default components present in GUI
             # A base is created for GUI Development, where buttons, menu bars, etc., can be added.

root.mainloop()  # event loop called only once
